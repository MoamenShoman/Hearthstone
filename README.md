# Hearthstone Instructions
1.  **Selecting Heroes:** After pressing on “Start Game” button at
    initial screen, you will be directed to a page that is divided into
    2 parts. Each part is intended for one player and contains 5 buttons
    to enable the player to choose between the 5 different classes
    available in the game. Then, you should press on “Play” button to
    start the actual game.

2.  **Playing Minions:** The current hero’s hand cards will appear on
    the right and the left of the hero’s label. In order to play a
    minion to the field, you just click on it.

3.  **Casting Spells:** As stated in the previous point, the spells will
    also appear on the right and the left of the hero’s label. To cast a
    spell, you also click on its image. If it requires a target (i.e., a
    Minion Target Spell, Hero Target Spell or Leeching Spell) you will
    be prompted to select a target. Then, you should click on the target
    you want the spell to affect to trigger the spell’s effect.

4.  **Attacking with Minions:** To attack with a minion, you should
    first click on the attacker minion that is on the current hero’s
    field. After that, you will be prompted to choose a target. Then,
    you should click on the target (either a minion or a hero).

5.  **Ending Turn:** You will find a button on the right of the screen
    labeled “End Turn” to trigger ending turn functionality.

6.  **Screen Orientation:** The current hero, all its related info and
    different types of cards are always at the bottom of the screen and
    the opponent hero is at the top. After ending turn, the heroes’
    positions are switched to match those settings.

7.  **Other Details:**

    1.  To play the game, you should run `Controller` class found in the
        package: “Controller”.

    2.  The window size of the game is 1440*817.

    3.  The vast majority of the errors and exceptions are reported
        through sounds.

    4.  The rarity of a minion is written clearly at the bottom of each
        minion whether it is in the hand or in the field. For the other
        properties (Taunt, Divine Shield and Charge), they are indicated
        with the first letter of each property written next to the
        rarity (**T** for taunt, **D** for divine shield and **C** for
        charge.)

    5.  **Non-sleeping** minions are indicated with a green border
        around them. On the other hand, **sleeping** minions have black
        borders.
